# Traffic Environment Complexity Calculation Model

This repository contains the code and documentation for my undergraduate thesis on the traffic environment complexity calculation model. The thesis discusses the importance of traffic environment complexity in autonomous vehicle testing and safety evaluation, and proposes a novel method for calculating both static and dynamic traffic environment complexity.

## Thesis Abstract

Traffic environment complexity is a critical factor in designing test scenarios for autonomous vehicles and evaluating their overall safety functions. High-complexity traffic scenarios are strongly correlated with accidents, making their testing crucial for improving autonomous vehicle testing efficiency. This thesis addresses the limitations of existing static traffic environment complexity calculation models by considering 11 static influencing factors and their contributions. A method combining information entropy and grey relational analysis is proposed to establish a static complexity model. The dynamic complexity model is derived using a gravitational model to analyze dynamic elements. The integrated model of static and dynamic complexity is then used to design eight typical urban and highway test scenarios. The study shows that the static complexity of urban and highway scenarios primarily depends on static elements, while the maximum instantaneous dynamic complexity of highways is significantly higher than that of urban roads.
